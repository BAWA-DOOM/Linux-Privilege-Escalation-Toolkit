# Linux Privilege Escalation Toolkit

## Overview
This project demonstrates **Linux privilege escalation fundamentals** through structured system enumeration and controlled exploitation scenarios.

The focus is on understanding **why** privilege escalation works, not just running automated tools.

---

## Problem Statement
Most successful privilege escalation attacks occur due to:
- Misconfigured SUID binaries
- Weak sudo permissions
- Insecure cron jobs
- Poor system hardening

---

## What This Project Does
- Enumerates kernel and OS details
- Identifies SUID binaries
- Analyzes cron job configurations
- Demonstrates controlled privilege escalation logic

---

## Enumeration Strategy
The toolkit follows an **enumeration-first approach**:
1. System information gathering
2. Permission and binary analysis
3. Misconfiguration identification
4. Exploitation reasoning

## Security Concepts Covered
- Linux permissions model
- SUID exploitation logic
- Privilege boundaries
- Enumeration methodology

---

## Tech Stack
- Bash
- Linux internals

---

## Why This Matters
Effective attackers and defenders both rely on **deep system understanding**.
This project reflects real-world red team and security engineering practices.
