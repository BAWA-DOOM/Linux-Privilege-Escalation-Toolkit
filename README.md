\# Linux Privilege Escalation Toolkit



\## Overview

This toolkit demonstrates Linux privilege escalation techniques through structured system enumeration.



\## Modules

\- System \& kernel enumeration

\- SUID binary discovery

\- Cron job analysis

\- Controlled exploit demonstration



\## Why Enumeration Matters

Most real-world privilege escalation attacks succeed due to misconfigurations, not zero-days.



\## Tech Stack

\- Bash

\- Linux Internals
